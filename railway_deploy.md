# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `yoel-ai-coach`
3. Make it public (Railway works better with public repos)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add your GitHub repo as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yoel-ai-coach.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Railway

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your `yoel-ai-coach` repository
6. Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app
7. Click "Deploy"

## Step 4: Configure Environment

Railway will automatically:
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Use the start command from `railway.json`
- Assign a public URL

## Step 5: Access Your App

1. Once deployed, Railway will show your app URL
2. It will look like: `https://yoel-ai-coach-production.up.railway.app`
3. Bookmark this URL on your phone!

## Step 6: Test Mobile Access

1. Open the Railway URL on your phone
2. Test the Quick Log feature
3. Test the AI Chat
4. Verify data is being saved

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the Railway logs for errors
2. Make sure all files are committed to GitHub
3. Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies

### If app doesn't load:
1. Check if the URL is correct
2. Wait a few minutes for deployment to complete
3. Check Railway logs for startup errors
