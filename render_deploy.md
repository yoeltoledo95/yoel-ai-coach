# ðŸš€ Render Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it: `yoel-ai-coach`
3. Make it **Public** (Render works better with public repos)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add your GitHub repo as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yoel-ai-coach.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Render

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
5. Select your `yoel-ai-coach` repository
6. Configure:
   - **Name**: `yoel-ai-coach`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `streamlit run mobile_logger.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0`

7. Click "Create Web Service"

## Step 4: Wait for Deployment

Render will:
