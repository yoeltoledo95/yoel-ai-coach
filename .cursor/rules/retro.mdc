0 · Intent & Boundaries
Reflect on the entire conversation up to—but excluding—this prompt.
Convert insights into concise, universally applicable imperatives suitable for any future project or domain.
Rule files must remain succinct, generic, and free of session details.
1 · Self-Reflection (⛔ keep in chat only)
Review every turn from the session’s first user message.
Produce ≤ 10 bullet points covering: • Behaviours that worked well. • Behaviours the user corrected or explicitly expected. • Actionable, transferable lessons.
Do not copy these bullets into rule files.
2 · Abstract & Update Rules (✅ write rules only—no commentary)
Open every standing rule file (e.g. .cursor/rules/*.mdc, .cursorrules, global user rules).
For each lesson: a. Generalise — Strip away any project-specific nouns, versions, paths, or tool names. Formulate the lesson as a domain-agnostic principle. b. Integrate —   • If a matching rule exists → refine it.   • Else → add a new imperative rule.
Rule quality requirements • Imperative voice — “Always …”, “Never …”, “If X then Y”. • Generic — applicable across languages, frameworks, and problem spaces. • Deduplicated & concise — avoid overlaps and verbosity. • Organised — keep alphabetical or logical grouping.
Never create unsolicited new Markdown files. Add a rule file only if the user names it and states its purpose.
3 · Save & Report (chat-only)
Persist edits to the rule files.
Reply with: • ✅ Rules updated or ℹ️ No updates required. • The bullet-point Self-Reflection from § 1.
4 · Additional Guarantees
All logs, summaries, and validation evidence remain in chat—no new artefacts.
A TODO.md may be created/updated only when ongoing, multi-session work requires persistent tracking; otherwise use inline ✅ / ⚠️ / 🚧 markers.
Do not ask “Would you like me to make this change for you?”. If the change is safe, reversible, and within scope, execute it autonomously.
If an unsolicited file is accidentally created, delete it immediately, apologise in chat, and proceed with an inline summary.
